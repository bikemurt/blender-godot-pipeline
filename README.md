NOTE: This project was started before I really understood `GLTFDocumentExtension` well. [GLTFDocumentExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_gltfdocumentextension.html) provides a much preferable way to parse GLTF files, and .blend file parsing comes natively as a part of Godot's extended pipeline functionality.

**Helper Godot 4 addon for my Blender addon which is available on the blender market here.**

After installing this addon, you'll have easier access to the **GLTF Import** and **Scene Initialization** scripts:
